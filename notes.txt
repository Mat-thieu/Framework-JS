router flow

add namespaces using this var testNamespace = router.makeNamespace('/test');
this will add /test to a namespace storage together with the functions that need to get executed when on this namespace
namespaces are checked before anything else


Things to track

Whether any route has been chosen (if not and there is a 404, fire the 404)
